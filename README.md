A collection of tools for testing and experimenting with IPv6 connectivity. This project provides a simple client-server implementation to verify IPv6 communication.

## üåü Features

- IPv6 server implementation
- IPv6 client implementation
- Real-time message exchange
- Timestamp-based logging
- Configurable port and IPv6 address
- Support for both local and remote IPv6 connections
- Automatic listing of available IPv6 addresses on the host
- Multi-client support (up to 10 simultaneous connections)

## üìã Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Go 1.22.4 or higher
- Docker 27.5 or higher
- IPv6-enabled network environment
- Basic understanding of IPv6 addressing

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ipv6-tools.git
cd ipv6-tools
```

## üê≥ Docker

1. Build the container images.
```bash
./build.sh
```

## üíª Usage

### Container Versions

The `IPv6` tester utilities may be run in either server or client mode.

#### Running as Server

```bash
docker run --rm -it ipv6tester-java
```

#### Running as Client

```bash
docker run --rm -it ipv6tester-java IPv6Tester.java client
```

The pattern is similar for the Python utility. Invoke the Python container (`ipv6tester-python`) and substitute `ipv6_tester.py` for `IPv6Tester.java`. Additional address and port parameters apply as below.

### Java Version

The `IPv6Tester` class can be run in either server or client mode. Here are the basic usage patterns:

#### Running as Server

```bash
java java/src/IPv6Tester.java server [ipv6_address] [port]
```

#### Running as Client

```bash
java java/src/IPv6Tester.java client [ipv6_address] [port]
```

#### Viewing Available IPv6 Addresses

To see all available IPv6 addresses on your system, simply run the tool without any arguments:

```bash
java java/src/IPv6Tester.java
```

### Python Version

The Python version provides the same functionality using async/await patterns. Here are the usage patterns:

#### Running as Server

```bash
python python/src/ipv6_tester.py server [ipv6_address] [port]
```

#### Running as Client

```bash
python python/src/ipv6_tester.py client [ipv6_address] [port]
```

#### Viewing Available IPv6 Addresses

To see all available IPv6 addresses on your system, simply run the tool without any arguments:

```bash
python python/src/ipv6_tester.py
```

## üìù Examples

### Java Examples

1. View available IPv6 addresses and usage help:
```bash
java java/src/IPv6Tester.java
```

2. Start a server on the default IPv6 address (::1) and port (8080):
```bash
java java/src/IPv6Tester.java server
```

3. Start a server on a specific IPv6 address and port:
```bash
java java/src/IPv6Tester.java server 2001:db8:1234:5678::1 8888
```

4. Connect a client to the server:
```bash
java java/src/IPv6Tester.java client 2001:db8:1234:5678::1 8888
```

### Python Examples

1. View available IPv6 addresses and usage help:
```bash
python python/src/ipv6_tester.py
```

2. Start a server on the default IPv6 address (::1) and port (8080):
```bash
python python/src/ipv6_tester.py server
```

3. Start a server on a specific IPv6 address and port:
```bash
python python/src/ipv6_tester.py server 2001:db8:1234:5678::1 8888
```

4. Connect a client to the server:
```bash
python python/src/ipv6_tester.py client 2001:db8:1234:5678::1 8888
```

## üîç How it Works

- The server listens for incoming IPv6 connections on the specified address and port
- The client connects to the server and sends messages
- The server responds with timestamps and acknowledgment messages
- Both sides log all communication for debugging purposes
- The server can handle up to 10 simultaneous client connections
- When no arguments are provided, the tool displays available IPv6 addresses on the system

## üìä Output Examples

### Server Mode Output

When running in server mode, you'll see output like this:
```
IPv6 Server started on [2001:db8:1234:5678::1]:8080
Maximum number of simultaneous clients: 10
Client connected from: [2001:db8:1234:5678::2]
Received from client [2001:db8:1234:5678::2]: Hello from IPv6 client at 2024-03-21 14:30:45
```

The server will:
1. Display the IPv6 address and port it's listening on
2. Show the maximum number of simultaneous clients allowed
3. Show when a client connects, including the client's IPv6 address
4. Log each message received from the client
5. Send back acknowledgment messages with timestamps

### Client Mode Output

When running in client mode, you'll see output like this:
```
Connected to server at [2001:db8:1234:5678::1]:8080
Sent to server: Hello from IPv6 client at 2024-03-21 14:30:45
Server response: Server received your message at 2024-03-21 14:30:45 at address 2001:db8:1234:5678::1
```

The client will:
1. Confirm successful connection to the server
2. Show each message sent to the server
3. Display the server's response with timestamps
4. Continue this pattern for 20 iterations with 1-second delays between messages

### Available IPv6 Addresses Output

When running without arguments, you'll see output like this:
```
Usage: python ipv6_tester.py <server|client> [ipv6_address] [port]
  server|client    - Required. Run as server or client
  ipv6_address     - Optional. IPv6 address (default: ::1)
  port             - Optional. Port number (default: 8080)

Available IPv6 addresses on this host:
  eth0: 2001:db8:1234:5678::1
  wlan0: 2001:db8:abcd:efgh::1
  lo: ::1

Python IPv6 related properties:
  socket.AF_INET6: 10
  socket.has_ipv6: True
  IPV6_V6ONLY environment variable: not set

System IPv6 configuration:
  System IPv6 enabled: true
  (On macOS, shows: System IPv6 forwarding: net.inet6.ip6.forwarding: 1)

Examples:
  python ipv6_tester.py server
  python ipv6_tester.py server 2001:db8:1234:5678::1
  python ipv6_tester.py client 2001:db8:1234:5678::1 8888
```

The output includes:
1. Available IPv6 addresses on the system
2. Python's IPv6 capabilities and configuration
3. System-level IPv6 status
4. Usage examples and command-line options
